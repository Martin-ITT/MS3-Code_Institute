Third Milestone project will demonstrate Back End Data Centric Development skills using Python and MongoDB.
Inspiration for "In Vino Veritas" was sourced from wisdom found in Latin Quotes. These are very popular around many people. It will not only gather the most famous quotes but also aims to be the largest collection as users can add their favourite ones too.

# 1. UX 👌
## 1.1 Strategy 👪

The goal of this project is to provide friendly database for users while they can update database themselves. Professional and resposinve design should attract people to create an account and build this project further. 

### User stories

With an agile approach I will be focusing on both external and internal clients.

As user I would like to:

- view popular latin quotes and their authors
- create and delete an account
- trust this page where my data will be stored securly
- log in and log out
- add, edit and delete my favourite qoutes
- display a random quote for the day
- easy navigation menu
- responsive design for mobile devices

As a website owner I would like to:

 - admin account to be able manage details of authors
 - admin account to be able manage standard user accounts
 - attract users with intuitive design
