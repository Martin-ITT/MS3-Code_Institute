# In Vino Veritas
## [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)
### Full Stack Web Development Course
### Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric Development
--------------------------------------
![In Vino Veritas](img/Capture.JPG "In Vino Veritas")

Third Milestone project will demonstrate Back End Data Centric Development skills using Python and MongoDB.
Inspiration for "In Vino Veritas" was sourced from wisdom found in Latin Quotes. These are very popular around many people and I will try to spread these out even further. It will not only gather the most famous quotes but it also aims to be the largest collection as users can add their favourite ones too. 


<span id="ux"></span>
# 1. UX üëå
## 1.1 Strategy üë™

The goal of this project is to provide friendly database of latin quotes for users while they can update it themselves. Professional and resposinve design should attract more people to create an account and extend this project beyond my expectations. 

### User stories

With an agile approach I will be focusing on both external and internal clients.

As user I would like to:

- view popular latin quotes and their authors
- create and delete an account
- trust this page where my data will be stored securly
- log in and log out
- add, edit and delete my favourite qoutes
- display a quote of the day
- display my favourite quotes
- easy navigation menu
- responsive design for mobile devices

As a website owner I would like to:

 - admin account to be able manage details of authors
 - attract users with intuitive design
 - have the quotes sorted according user needs - name, popularity etc...


## 1.2 Scope 

From our strategy plan there were few funcionalities identified in order to satisfy user needs. To implement Minimum Viable Product our product will need folowing features:

- welcoming main page
- appropriate navigation
- responsive design
- page with latin qoutes content and search function
- user page to add, update, display and delete quotes
- user page with favourite quotes
- admin access to maintain the database
- registration page, log in page
- database model
- database of users
- databes of authors and a database of quotes
- back-end feature to access our data for CRUD funcionality

## 1.3 Structure

Front-end

In Vino Veritas contains structured navbar for easy navigation. Following links are displayed when no user is logged in. First link - In Vino Veritas - brings user to index page providing quote of the day. Second link - Random Quote displays randomly generated quote every time clicked. Third link - All quotes - navigates to page displaying all quotes in database, sort funcionality, a search bar and how many users likes certain qoute. Third link brings user to log in page and fourth provides the user registration form.
When user is logged in the first three links remain the same. There is added funcionality for user to like or unlike quote on the all quotes page. Fourth link reads - My qoutes - which displays qoutes added by user. Add a new qoute, edit and delete funcionality is also on the same page. Fifth link - Favourite Quotes - return page with quotes which user likes. On the next page - Profile - can users change password or completely delete their account. Last one - Log Out - terminates user session and returnes to Log In page.
When admin is logged in the navbar also containes Manage Authors link to maintain the Authors database.
Same as navbar, every page displays consistent footer with Copyright section on a left side. The right corner contains a name of user who is curently logged in. A message "No user logged in" reads if no active user is loged in.
